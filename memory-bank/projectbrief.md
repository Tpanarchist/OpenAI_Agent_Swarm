# Project Brief

## Core Mission

The Hierarchical Autonomous Agent Swarm (HAAS) project aims to create fully autonomous AI systems that operate under ethical governance. Our mission is to develop self-organizing swarms of AI agents that can work harmoniously without constant human supervision.

## Three Pillars of Full Autonomy

1. **Self-Directing**
   - Acts independently based on heuristic imperatives
   - Makes decisions aligned with ethical principles
   - Pursues mission goals without supervision
   - Guided by universal axioms and human rights

2. **Self-Correcting**
   - Detects and resolves errors autonomously
   - Implements robust error detection systems
   - Maintains integrity through continuous assessment
   - Adapts based on performance analysis

3. **Self-Improving**
   - Enhances capabilities over time
   - Implements incremental upgrades
   - Engages in continuous learning
   - Maintains stable growth trajectory

## Heuristic Imperatives

1. **Reduce Suffering in the Universe**
   - Alleviate pain and distress
   - Work towards minimizing hardship
   - Consider impact on all forms of intelligence

2. **Increase Prosperity in the Universe**
   - Enhance well-being for all
   - Foster growth and development
   - Create sustainable abundance

3. **Increase Understanding in the Universe**
   - Advance knowledge and wisdom
   - Promote learning and discovery
   - Share insights across systems

## Project Goals

1. **Create an Autonomous Agent Hierarchy**
   - Implement Supreme Oversight Board (SOB)
   - Develop Executive Agent layer
   - Enable creation of specialized Sub-Agents

2. **Establish Ethical Governance**
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Enforce privilege inheritance
   - Maintain ethical alignment

3. **Enable Self-Organization**
   - Support dynamic agent creation
   - Implement termination protocols
   - Ensure system stability

4. **Drive Innovation**
   - Use cutting-edge technologies
   - Push boundaries of current capabilities
   - Document successes and failures

## Success Criteria

1. Agents demonstrate ability to:
   - Self-direct based on mission parameters
   - Detect and correct errors autonomously
   - Improve capabilities over time

2. System maintains:
   - Ethical alignment with core imperatives
   - Stable hierarchical structure
   - Effective self-organization

3. Documentation provides:
   - Clear project understanding
   - Technical implementation details
   - Progress tracking and updates
