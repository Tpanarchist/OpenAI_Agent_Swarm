# Progress Tracking

## Current Status

### Memory Bank Implementation
âœ… Established memory-bank directory
âœ… Created core documentation files:
  - projectbrief.md
  - productContext.md
  - systemPatterns.md
  - techContext.md
  - activeContext.md
  - progress.md (this file)

### Project Infrastructure
âœ… Project structure in place
âœ… Core components identified:
  - Agent Builder System

   - Usage examples - to be added
   - Error handling - needs documentation

### Technical
1. **System Integration**
   - OpenAI API setup pending
   - Discord integration not started
   - GitHub integration incomplete
   - Inter-agent communication undefined

2. **Development**
   - Testing framework incomplete
   - CI/CD pipeline needed
   - Deployment process undefined
   - Monitoring system required
